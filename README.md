To run my Battleship game, double-click on the .jar file. It is a runnable jar. A GUI should pop up.
The game can run in both server mode and client mode. To get to these modes click on Battle, 
Com vs. Com, Host or Join (depending on whether you want to be the server or the client respectively),
then type in the requested information, and then click Host a Game or Join a Game. 
If you wish to go back up one level just click the buttons on the side. 
Once you have chosen to start a game, information will be shone in the console labels Headquarters. 
If you cannot see certain information, then just resize the screen and it should pop right up. 

If you have any questions or comments then email me at ddarji@spsu.edu.
Thank you and have fun battling.

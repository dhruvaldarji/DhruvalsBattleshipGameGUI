     To run my Battleship game, double-click on the .jar file. It is a runnable jar. A GUI should pop up.There are currently 2 game types, 
Com vs. Com and Player vs. Com. The Com vs. Com game can run in both server mode or client mode. To get to these modes click on Battle, 
Com vs. Com, Host or Join (depending on whether you want to be the server or the client respectively), then type in the requested 
information, and then click Host a Game or Join a Game. If you wish to go back up one level just click the buttons on the side. 
The Player vs. Com can be reached in a similar fashion. Once you have chosen to start a game, information will be shown in the console 
labeled Headquarters. 

If you have any questions or comments then email me at ddarji@spsu.edu.

Thank you and have fun battling!
